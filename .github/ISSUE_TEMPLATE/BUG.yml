        ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**
        Before you submit an bug, please perform the following first:

        1. Remove the local `.terraform` directory (! ONLY if state is stored remotely, which hopefully you are following that best practice!): `rm -rf .terraform/`
        2. Re-initialize the project root to pull down modules: `terraform init`
        3. Re-attempt your terraform plan or apply and check if the issue still persists
